      <H1>Nice to meet you, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹</H1>

      <P>
        I'm a British born Engineering Leader that's been in the US for the past
        7 years, and live with my wife Dana in Brooklyn, NY (more specifically,
        in Brooklyn Heights).
      </P>

      <P>
        I've been a software engineer for the past 10 years, starting life in
        digital marketing after getting a Computer Science degree. I quickly
        realized that marketing wasn't totally where I wanted to be, and after
        falling into the Lean Startup scene in London and becoming obsessed with
        the book by Eric Reis, I switched to a more product focussed role at{" "}
        <Link to="https://madebymany.com">Made by Many</Link>, where I learned
        to appreciate customer-centric product development techniques.
      </P>

      <P>
        Working at Made by Many lead me to NYC, where I helped establish and
        help lead our NYC based office, ultimately working as Technical Director
        of a team of 4 engineers and growing the studio to 12 people. After Made
        by Many, I lead the engineering team at{" "}
        <Link to="https://frame.io">Frame.io</Link> through Series A â€“ C and
        helped re-platform to Elixir and React, growing the engineering team
        from 7 - 30.
      </P>

      <P>
        After Frame.io I did a stint as CTO at an early-stage Healthcare
        startup, <Link to="https://murumed.com">Muru</Link> building a mobile
        app to help EMTs get access to life-saving, critical care information.
        Ultimately deciding that healthcare wasn't for me, I now{" "}
        <Link to="/work-with-me">consult as a CTO for hire</Link> while I
        explore some startup ideas of my own.
      </P>

      <H2>Technical Expertise</H2>

      <P>
        Throughout my career I've been lucky enough to really work across the
        full-stack; and while my focus has shifted over the last few years to be
        quite Elixir and backend dominated, I still love to build applications
        end-to-end.
      </P>

      <P>
        Some technology I've used recently: Elixir, NodeJS, Ruby-on-Rails,
        React, React Native. I've worked on systems in AWS and Google Cloud.
      </P>

      <H2>Outside of work</H2>

      <P>
        Outside of things on a screen, I love to cycle, play squash, camp, hike
        and generally be outside. I'm also known to play the odd round of
        Fortnite.
